# Killer Game Design Documents

This game is based on the Killer Game series on [Wah!Banana Too](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2KpFcpMiYXaomrhQEtx5Mw).

## Basic rules

There are two general groups of players: Good and Bad. The Bad players are the various killers, and the Good players are civilians and superpowers. If all of the civilians or all of the superpowers die, the Bad players win. If all of the killers die, the Good players win.  
The game runs on a day-night cycle, with the night-time and day-time having different possible actions. During the night, players can't see other's actions. During the day, the results of the night are revealed, and the players can discuss them. At the end the daytime, the players vote one person who they think is a killer.
